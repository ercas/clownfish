        <h1>About Clownfish</h1>
        <span class=description>Jump to: <a href=#security>security</a> <a href=#tools>tools</a></span>
        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clownfish is an <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemerality>ephemeral</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software>free and open source</a> (FOSS) file conversion service acting as a frontend for many <a href=#tools>FOSS tools</a> that can convert files from one format to another.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clownfish can be deployed quickly as a <a href=https://www.docker.com/>Docker</a> container or in a virtual machine to serve file conversion needs for people without access to a Unix-like operating system. It can also be deployed on a barebones Linux install, but in this case, it would no longer be ephemeral.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The source code for Clownfish is available on <a href=https://github.com/ercas/clownfish/>GitHub</a> under an <a href=https://github.com/ercas/clownfish/blob/master/LICENSE>MIT License</a>. This means you can do whatever you want with the source code as long as you include the license in derivative works and don't hold the author liable.

        <h2 id=security>Clownfish is not secure!</h2>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clownfish is currently an insecure service; any file that you send to or receive from Clownfish can be intercepted by a third party. Do not use Clownfish over the Internet for any sensitive file conversions; instead, run it in a container or virtual machine on your home network and make sure that there are no bad actors on your network and that Clownfish is not connected to the Internet.
        </p>
