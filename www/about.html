        <span class=description>a universal file conversion service</a>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clownfish is an <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemerality>ephemeral</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software>free and open source</a> (FOSS) file conversion service, acting as a web-based frontend for many FOSS tools that can convert files from one format to another.
            <br>
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clownfish can be deployed quickly as a <a href=https://www.docker.com/>Docker</a> container or in a virtual machine to serve file conversion needs for people without access to a Unix-like operating system. It can also be deployed on a barebones Linux install, but in this case, it would no longer be ephemeral.
